I was born in Salamanca, Spain. Taking pictures is one of my passions, that's why I created this little page, to show you my stories.

I started with film photography in 2012 and since then I've made a few rolls of film. But I've been taking pictures since 2005, period in which I got my first camera.

Nowadays I usually do more travel photography, years ago I used to do a lot of skateboard and music photography.
